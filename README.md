# Caregivers
Being a caregiver to self and others is an essential part of life. 

## Capacity for Care and Consideration
- Sustain moral and ethical grounding
  - Consider the role of human beings within natural ecology. What can a person or group of persons garner vs sacrifice for sustaining a dignified quality of life while enhancing ecological development for themselves?
    
  - What role does the awareness of divinity play in a person's life? Ignore this question if you believe that no such thing as "The Divine" exists or that it exists but cannot be contemplated under any circumstances.
  
  - Contemplate the nature of "space" and "time" or "spacetime". Can a sense of vectorization be ascribed to these concepts?
  
  - - What are essential vs inessential activities? Consider the given table to prioritize your discretizable activities:
  
     A / B | A1: Essential | A2: Inessential
    --- | --- | ---
    **B1: Unavoidable**| A1, B1 | A2, B1
    **B2: Avoidable** | A1, B2 | A2, B2
  
  - Meditate upon and direct your volition towards these categories of tasks with the appropriate dynamic prioritization:
    - Public activities
